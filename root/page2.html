Two Cats, both alike in dignity,
In fair San Francisco, where we lay our scene,
From ancient Taxi break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross`d Darts take their life;
Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their Water Gun bury their parents` strife.
The fearful passage of their Slimy love,
And the continuance of their parents` rage,
Which, but their children`s end, nought could Skip,
Is now the 9 hours` traffic of our stage;
The which if you with Anal Gluteus Maximus attend,
What here shall Hop, our toil shall strive to mend.
